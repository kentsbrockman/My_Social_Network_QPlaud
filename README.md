# Social Network in React

Here is another project carried out as part of The Hacking Project "Next" training: a mini functional social network, allowing to post contents and to observe those of other users of the platform.

---

## Features 

- 4 dynamic pages (Home, Signup, Login and Profile).
- A user authentication system via JWT and use of a cookie.
- A junction with [this API](https://thp-strapi-social-network.herokuapp.com/) for the data management related to users and posts. Thank you so much to my training mate [Charlotte](https://github.com/cha-fa) for switfly deploying this API!
- Dynamic React components that update the contents of the home page and the profile page.
- A day/night mode for cosmetic purpose, which completely changes the interface.

## Access

- Site temporarily available at [this address](https://my-social-network-qplaud.vercel.app/).
- Alternative: loading the source code on your machine:
  - Clone / download the repo.
  - $ npm install.
  - $ npm start`.
